title: "Tutor Feedback Sentiment Analysis"
excerpt: "At the University of Arizona's S.A.L.T. Center, I developed a Google Sheets plugin that performs sentiment analysis on tutor feedback. The tool flags positive (\"green\") and concerning (\"red\") comments to support early intervention and automate the process of review. This solo project utilized NLP techniques to help staff quickly interpret qualitative data."
